<h1>Contributing Scarab Datasets</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>To contribute useful scarab datasets, you'll need to collect data using the <strong>3-to-1 vendor recipe</strong>: sell 3 scarabs of the same type to a vendor to receive 1 random scarab back. This recipe allows you to systematically collect data about scarab conversion rates.</p>

<h2>Data Collection Approach</h2>

<p>The correct approach for collecting scarab data is to use the <strong>3-to-1 Vendor recipe</strong>. It is crucial to use the same Scarab as input for the trades to not scew the result. When using different scarabs as inputs, separate their resultings and treat them as different Datasets:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose Your Input Scarab</strong>: Select a specific scarab type to use as input (e.g., Abyss Scarab, Ambush Scarab)</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Recipe</strong>: Sell 3 scarabs of that type to a vendor to receive 1 random scarab back</li>
<li><strong>Batch Collection</strong>: 
   <ul>
   <li>Since you can only fit 60 items in your inventory, and for efficiency, work in batches of 180 scarabs (3 batches of 60)</li>
   <li>Sell 180 input scarabs (3 × 60) to get 60 random scarabs back</li>
   <li>Repeat this process as many times as you can</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Record Results</strong>: Note exactly which scarab you used as input and all the scarabs you received back, including their counts</li>
<li><strong>Continue Collecting</strong>: The more batches you complete, the more accurate your dataset will be</li>
</ol>

<h2>Quality Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sample Size</strong>: Aim for at least 1000+ input scarabs for basic results, 10000+ for better accuracy</li>
<li><strong>Data Accuracy</strong>: Ensure all scarabs received from the vendor are accurately counted, you can setup a dedicated stashtab and use eg wealthyexile to support in the counting</li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: Include all scarab types that you received back, even if count is 0</li>
<li><strong>Input Tracking</strong>: Clearly document which scarab type you used as input</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use the Vendor Recipe</strong>: Always use the 3-to-1 vendor recipe (sell 3 scarabs → get 1 back) with the same Scarab</li>
<li><strong>Work in Batches</strong>: Process in batches of 180 (3 inventory loads of 60) for efficiency</li>
<li><strong>Track Input Carefully</strong>: Clearly note which scarab type you're using as input</li>
<li><strong>Count Accurately</strong>: Count all output scarabs</li>
<li><strong>(Optinal) Multiple Sessions</strong>: Collect data over multiple sessions to build a larger sample size</li>
</ul>
