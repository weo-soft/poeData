<h2>Why Your Contributions Matter</h2>

<p>To accurately calculate item weightings and probabilities, we need as many datasets as possible. Each dataset you
    contribute helps improve the accuracy of weight calculations for the entire community.</p>

<p>More datasets = More accurate calculations</p>

<h2>How to collect data</h2>

<p>The most basic information that are needed in the dataset are the <strong></strong>items that were used as
    input</strong> and the <strong>items that were received as output</strong>.</p>
<p>In general you should only use one item as an input per dataset, different inputs should be treated as different
    datasets.</p>

<p>There are two main approaches to collect data on the weight of the items:
<ul>
    <li>Using a Vendor recipe (3-to-1)</li>
    <li>Rerolling the item using the Harvest Bench.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The Vendor recipe in general accepts any combination of items of the same type, though you should only use the same
    item as input per dataset to recieve accurate results.</p>
<p>The same approach, of only using one item as an input per dataset, applies to the harvest bench as well.</p>
<p>When using the Harvest Bench to reroll items it is recommended to use single items to reroll, since using stacks does
    not provide any additional information about the weight, but increases the costs per transaction while reducing the
    number of transactions for the same amount of items.</p>

<p><Strong>Note:</Strong> There are certain item categories that have slightly different or additional approaches on collecting data, notably Scarabs, Divination Cards and Contracts, the Details are located in the respective category pages.</p>

<h2>Submitting your data</h2>

<p>When submitting your dataset, you should include the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Input Items</strong>: The items you used as input</li>
    <li><strong>Items</strong>: The output items with their counts</li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong>: A short description of how the data was obtained</li>
    <li><strong>Date</strong>: The date when the data was collected (format: YYYY-MM-DD)</li>
    <li><strong>Patch</strong>: (Optional) The game patch version (e.g., "3.26.0")</li>
</ul>

<p>If you made a post, eg. on reddit or discord, you can also include the link to the post in the submission.</p>

<h2>Dataset size recommendations</h2>

<p>Since we are trying to calculate/estimate probabilities we need datasets with as many transactions as possible. The more transactions you have, the more accurate the results will be.</p>

<p>It is recommend to collect at least 1000+ input items for basic results, and 10000+ for better accuracy.</p>


<h2>How to Submit</h2>

<p>Datasets can be submitted by using the <a href="#/submit">dataset submission interface</a> to either using the form to directly fill in your data or by providing your data via a file or link.</p>
