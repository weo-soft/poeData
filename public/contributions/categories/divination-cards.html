<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For general information on contributing datasets, please refer to the <a href="#/contributions/generic">Contribution page</a>.</p>


<p>There is one approach to collect data on weightings:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Opening Stacked Decks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opening Stacked Decks</h2>

<p>Stacked Decks are consumable items that grant a single random Divination card when opened. Opening Stacked Decks and recording every card you receive is sufficient to collect data on the weight of Divination cards.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Obtain Stacked Decks</strong>: Acquire Stacked Decks through gameplay (drops, league mechanics, or trading)</li>
<li><strong>Open Stacked Decks</strong>: Use each Stacked Deck to receive one random Divination card</li>
<li><strong>Record Results</strong>: Note every Divination card you receive.</li>
<li><strong>Continue Collecting</strong>: The more Stacked Decks you open and record, the more accurate your dataset will be</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is recommended to collect at least 10000+ opened Stacked Decks for basic results, and 100000+ for better accuracy.</p>
