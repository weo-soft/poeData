<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For general information on contributing datasets, please refer to the <a href="#/contributions/generic">Contribution page</a>.</p>


<p>There are two approaches to collect data on weightings:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Using a Vendor recipe (3-to-1)</li>
   <li>Opening veiled Scarabs (Only available in Standard)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3-to-1 Vendor recipe</h2>

<p>When using the Vendor recipe, it is important to use the same Scarab as input for the trades to not scew the result. When using different scarabs as inputs, separate the results and treat them as different Datasets:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose Your Input Scarab</strong>: Select a specific scarab type to use as input (e.g., Abyss Scarab, Ambush Scarab)</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Recipe</strong>: Sell 3 scarabs of that type to a vendor to receive 1 random scarab back</li>
<li><strong>Batch Collection</strong>: 
   <ul>
   <li>Since you can only fit 60 items in your inventory, and for efficiency, work in batches of 180 scarabs (3 batches of 60)</li>
   <li>Sell 180 input scarabs (3 × 60) to get 60 random scarabs back</li>
   <li>Repeat this process as many times as you can</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Record Results</strong>: Note exactly which scarab you used as input and all the scarabs you received back, including their counts</li>
<li><strong>Continue Collecting</strong>: The more batches you complete, the more accurate your dataset will be</li>
</ol>

<h2>Opening veiled Scarabs</h2>
<p>Veiled Scarabs are only available in Standard. When opening veiled Scarabs, you will receive a random Scarab.</p>
<p>Simply opening the veiled Scarabs and recording the Scarab you received is sufficient to collect data on the weight of the Scarabs.</p>
