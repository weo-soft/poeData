<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For general information on contributing datasets, please refer to the <a href="#/contributions/generic">Contribution page</a>.</p>


<p>There is one approach to collect data on weightings:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Rerolling Essences using the Harvest Bench</li>
</ul>

<h2>Harvest Bench Reroll</h2>

<p>When using the Harvest Bench to reroll Essences, it is important to use the same Essence as input for the trades to not skew the result. When using different Essences as inputs, separate the results and treat them as different Datasets:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose Your Input Essence</strong>: Select a specific Essence type to use as input (e.g., Essence of Greed, Essence of Contempt)</li>
<li><strong>Harvest Bench Reroll</strong>: Use the Harvest Bench to reroll a single Essence at a time</li>
<li><strong>Batch Collection</strong>: 
   <ul>
   <li>Reroll items one at a time (do not use stacks, as this doesn't provide additional information but increases costs)</li>
   <li>Record each reroll result individually</li>
   <li>Repeat this process as many times as you can</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Record Results</strong>: Note exactly which Essence you used as input and all the Essences you received back, including their counts</li>
<li><strong>Continue Collecting</strong>: The more rerolls you complete, the more accurate your dataset will be</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is recommended to collect at least 1000+ input items for basic results, and 10000+ for better accuracy.</p>
