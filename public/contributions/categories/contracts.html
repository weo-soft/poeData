<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For general information on contributing datasets, please refer to the <a href="#/contributions/generic">Contribution page</a>.</p>


<p>There is one approach to collect data on weightings:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Using a Vendor recipe (5-to-1)</li>
</ul>

<h2>5-to-1 Vendor recipe</h2>

<p>When using the Vendor recipe, Contracts must be <strong>rare</strong> before vendoring. The vendored Contracts must be of the same Contract type (eg. Bunker, Underbelly or Repository). 
   When using different Contract types as inputs, separate the results and treat them as different Datasets (one Dataset per Contract type). 
   You will receive a Contract with a random job type among the jobs that are viable for that Contract type.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose Your Input Contract Type</strong>: Select a specific Contract type to use as input</li>
<li><strong>Make Contracts Rare</strong>: Ensure all Contracts you vendor are rare (use Orbs of Alchemy or other means)*</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Recipe</strong>: Sell 5 rare Contracts of that type to a vendor to receive 1 Contract back with a random job type (from the jobs viable for that Contract type)</li>
<li><strong>Record Results</strong>: Note exactly which Contract type you used as input and the jobs the received Contracts have.</li>
<li><strong>Continue Collecting</strong>: The more batches you complete, the more accurate your dataset will be</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is recommended to collect at least 1000+ vendore contracts for basic results, and 10000+ for better accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> *Items with the same name in the same batch, are treated as "mirrored" and will not result in a new Contract. I you happen to have two Contracts with the same name, swap them in between Batches..</p>
