<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For general information on contributing datasets, please refer to the <a href="#/contributions/generic">Contribution page</a>.</p>


<p>There is one approach to collect data on weightings:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Using a Vendor recipe (3-to-1)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3-to-1 Vendor recipe</h2>

<p>When using the Vendor recipe, it is important to use the same Runegraft as input for the trades to not skew the result. When using different runegrafts as inputs, separate the results and treat them as different Datasets:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose Your Input Runegraft</strong>: Select a specific runegraft type to use as input</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Recipe</strong>: Sell 3 runegrafts of that type to a vendor to receive 1 random runegraft back</li>
<li><strong>Batch Collection</strong>: 
   <ul>
   <li>Since you can only fit 60 items in your inventory, and for efficiency, work in batches of 180 runegrafts (18 stacks of 10)</li>
   <li>Sell 180 input runegrafts (18 × 10) to get 60 random runegrafts back</li>
   <li>Repeat this process as many times as you can</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Record Results</strong>: Note exactly which runegraft you used as input and all the runegrafts you received back, including their counts</li>
<li><strong>Continue Collecting</strong>: The more batches you complete, the more accurate your dataset will be</li>
</ol>
