<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For general information on contributing datasets, please refer to the <a href="#/contributions/generic">Contribution page</a>.</p>


<p>There is one approach to collect data on weightings:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Using a Vendor recipe (3-to-1)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3-to-1 Vendor recipe</h2>

<p>When using the Vendor recipe, it is important to use the same Tattoo as input for the trades to not scew the result. When using different tattoos as inputs, separate the results and treat them as different Datasets:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose Your Input Tattoo</strong>: Select a specific tattoo type to use as input (e.g., Tattoo of the Arohongui Moonwarden, Tattoo of the Rongokurai Turtle)</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Recipe</strong>: Sell 3 tattoos of that type to a vendor to receive 1 random tattoo back</li>
<li><strong>Batch Collection</strong>: 
   <ul>
   <li>Since you can only fit 60 items in your inventory, and for efficiency, work in batches of 180 tattoos (18 stacks of 10)</li>
   <li>Sell 180 input tattoos (18 × 10) to get 60 random tattoos back</li>
   <li>Repeat this process as many times as you can</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Record Results</strong>: Note exactly which tattoo you used as input and all the tattoos you received back, including their counts</li>
<li><strong>Continue Collecting</strong>: The more batches you complete, the more accurate your dataset will be</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Journey Tattoos can not be rerolled, neither as input nor as output.</p>
